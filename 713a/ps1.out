\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.4}{Double Auctions - The Borrowers: There are 30 students numbered 1,2,3, ...,30. Even students are lenders and odd students are borrowers. The lenders each have 1000 to lend, and the return available to any lender is 3\045 plus 0.01\045 \(known as a basis point\) times twice his student number. The borrower has a return on a project equal to 3\045 plus 0.01\045 times his student number. So a borrower borrows if he can get an interest rate below his project's return, and a lender lends if he can get an interest rate above the return he has available to him. What are all possible market clearing interest rates, and numbers of transactions?}{}% 4
